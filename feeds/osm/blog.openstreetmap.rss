<p>An <strong>OpenStreetMap Featured Image</strong> (otherwise known as &#8220;Image Of The Week&#8221;) is chosen each week. Recently we&#8217;ve been putting them out on <a href="https://twitter.com/OpenStreetMap">twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/OpenStreetMap/">facebook</a>, so you&#8217;ll most likely have seen them there. Actually we&#8217;re a little behind on posting them, so consider this a preview! But featured images also appear each week on <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Main_Page">the wiki main page</a>.</p>
<p>If you come across an image which you would like to put forward as image of the week (either your own image or somebody else&#8217;s), head over to &#8220;<a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Featured_image_proposals">Featured image proposals</a>&#8221; and edit that page to make your suggestion there. Anyone can join in with the process of investigating, improving and discussing the suggestions, and picking an OpenStreetMap image of the week each week.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>OpenStreetMap is set to be the first world-wide geo database that actively tracks <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics">plate tectonics</a>. The OSM Foundation board has given the green light for tectonic correction to be applied to the OSM database, starting today.</p>
<p>You won&#8217;t notice it immediately &#8211; the changes are minuscule enough to be <a href="http://help.openstreetmap.org/questions/48912/how-do-i-protect-my-data/48931">laughed at by some.</a> But the effects are undeniable, and our always dedicated sysadmin team has been hard at work to devise queries against our database that correct for plate tectonics.</p>
<p>As you know, the earth&#8217;s surface is made of tectonic plates that drift apart slightly over time. With OSM using the WGS84 coordinate reference system (as opposed to e.g. ETRS89 which also has latitudes and longitudes but defines them relative to fixed markers), our coordinates get &#8220;out of sync&#8221; with time.</p>
<p><img style="box-shadow: none; border: 0;" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/Global_plate_motion_2008-04-17.jpg" alt="Plate motion based on Global Positioning System (GPS) satellite data from NASA JPL. The vectors show direction and magnitude of motion. (Wikimedia Commons)" /></p>
<p>This movement can amount to up to 10 centimetres per year. Luckily, models exist that tell us just how much the earth is moving at any given location. And of course our data model provides us not only with the latitude and longitude of a point, but also with the time when it was entered. Assuming the data was correct at the time of entering OpenStreetMap, we can compute exactly how much that particular point has moved in the time since it was entered, and we can update the coordinates accordingly. (This is, of course, just half of the story &#8211; where aerial imagery has been used to trace data, we rely on correct source tagging to automatically determine the date when the images were taken, to compute the applicable tectonic correction.)</p>
<p>A point that was entered just yesterday won&#8217;t move at all; a point entered at the same location 5 years ago may have to be moved by up to 0.5 metres.</p>
<p>In order not to burden our database with needless new version numbers for nearly all node objects, we&#8217;ve chosen to simply update the coordinates for all objects in-place; this means that the tectonic correction happens seamlessly, without leaving traces in the object history.</p>
<p>The first corrections will be applied today, and we&#8217;ll revisit the issue on the same day in the coming years.</p>
<p>If this all sounds like techno-babble to you &#8211; just take away one thing: OSM does everything in their power to achieve maximum data quality and accuracy.</p>

<h3>Why so early?</h3>
<p>Following on from previous years we are opening the call for venues early. This gives you the greatest flexibility over dates you can pick in 2018. It also makes it easier for others who may be wanting to run OpenStreetMap events – we can assist with calendar planning to help avoid any problematic clashes.</p>
<h3>How’s SotM 2017 shaping up?</h3>
<p>Planning for State of the Map 2017 in Aizuwakamatsu, Japan is coming along nicely. We are currently reviewing the applications for our scholarship program, whilst <a href="https://blog.openstreetmap.org/2017/02/16/propose-your-session-to-state-of-the-map-2017/">the call for proposals</a> closes this Sunday. Keep up to date with all the latest news about event tickets, hotel deals and the final program by <a href="http://2017.stateofthemap.org">signing up to our newsletter</a>.</p>
<h3>Contact us</h3>
<p>The State of the Map working group is here to help you. This year we have <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/State_of_the_Map_2018/Call_for_venues#Venue_and_catering">provided a template</a> to help you when it comes to recording details about potential venues and catering services. We encourage you to contact us on <a href="mailto:te%61m@state%6Ffthemap.org">team@stateofthemap.org</a> as early as possible so that we can provide guidance if required.</p>

<p><i>After careful consideration and consultation with Creative Commons, we have decided to continue our regime of asking for explicit permission for use in OpenStreetMap from licensors of CC BY databases and data.</i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although OpenStreetMap is largely created by volunteers that go out and map their neighbourhoods, we have often used external datasets to improve the map, either for cross-checking or more directly integrating the data. Many of these datasets are released on CC BY (Creative Commons Attribution) terms and that makes interoperability between these licences and our distribution licence, the ODbL 1.0, an important consideration for any use of such data in OSM. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both the 2.0 and 3.0 versions of the CC BY (Creative Commons Attribution) licence have been popular with government and other sources for a long time. Due to differences between CC BY and the ODbL with respect to attribution, the LWG (OSMF Licence/Legal Working Group) has always required explicit permission from licensors to use such data in OpenStreetMap and attribute by adding an entry to our attribution pages on our central websites.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CC BY 4.0 is a revision of the original CC BY license with provisions for handling database rights and simpler language. You can see a summary of differences between the licenses </span><a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/License_Versions"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The new version is becoming increasingly popular with potential data sources and we have received multiple requests to make a statement on compatibility of CC BY 4.0 licensed databases and data with the ODbL. For these reasons the LWG started, late last year, an effort to review the licence and to provide guidance to our contributors on the suitability of CC BY 4.0 material for OSM.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There had been some hope that CC BY 4.0 sources would be directly compatible with the ODbL. But while neither CC nor the OSMF has undertaken a complete compatibility analysis, we have identified at least one  point of incompatibility and one possible challenge regarding attribution that lead us to our decision to continue to ask for explicit permission to use BY 4.0-licensed material in the OSM project. This is the best path forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reasons for this decision are twofold: CC BY 4.0 allows some more flexibility in how a licensee can attribute the original source and many people have suggested that our indirect attribution mechanism already fulfills the requirements of BY 4.0. However the OSMF believes that licensors of BY 4.0 material may be surprised by this and that we should, for courtesy and good form reasons, continue to ask for explicit permission to attribute via our websites.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nd</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reason is that the CC BY licences contain a strict prohibition on distributing so licensed material with DRM-enabled media/transport. The ODbL contains a similar restriction, but allows parallel distribution of “Derivative Databases” as a way to fulfill the obligation for unrestricted access. Distribution of ODbL “Produced Works” (for example maps) does not even require that.To avoid this incompatibility we will be requiring an explicit waiver of the prohibition on applying Technological Effective Measures (as defined in the license) found in Section 2a5B of CC  BY 4.0.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To make obtaining the required permissions easier for everybody involved we have prepared a </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3PN5zfbzThqeTdWR1l3SzJVcTg/view?usp=sharing"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cover letter and a waiver form</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a similar document for obtaining the necessary waivers for the </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3PN5zfbzThqX0NNdFBDejE2RFE/view?usp=sharing"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2.0 and 3.0 versions of CC BY</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Please do not forget that imports need to follow our </span><a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Import/Guidelines"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Import Guidelines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and that having legal permission is just one of the required steps for a successful project using third party data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I would like to thank Creative Commons, in particular Diane Peters for the support during this process and Kathleen Lu from Mapbox for drafting the cover letters and waiver forms.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In case you missed the <a href="https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/announce/2017-February/000103.html">mailing lists announcement</a> from the Operations Working Group, there will be a one hour period of downtime next Sunday (week today) :</p>
<blockquote><p>We are planning to upgrade the software which runs the main OpenStreetMap database. Unfortunately, we cannot do this without a small amount of downtime. We would like to schedule this at a time which minimises the impact it will have, and plan to conduct the upgrade between <a title="find your timezone" href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=osm+database+downtime&amp;iso=20170312T11&amp;p1=%3A&amp;ah=1">11:00 and 12:00 UTC</a> on the morning of Sunday 12th March.</p>
<p>We expect that the database upgrade will not take the full hour, and we will endeavour to keep the site online for as much of that period as possible, and have it back to normal status as quickly as possible. However, there&#8217;s always the chance for things to go wrong, so please plan for the site to be down for the whole period.</p>
<p>The website and editing API will be affected, but other OSM services including the tile server, Nominatim, wiki, help and taginfo should continue to work as normal.</p>
<p>We will keep you updated through the <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Platform_Status">Platform Status</a> wiki page and <a href="https://twitter.com/OSM_Tech">OSM_Tech twitter account</a></p>
<p>If you experience any problems with the API after the end of the upgrade, please get in touch with us on the #osm <a href="https://irc.openstreetmap.org/">IRC channel</a>, or <a href="https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Operations_Working_Group#Contact">by email</a>.</p>
<p>Apologies for any disruption this may cause and many thanks in advance for your patience,</p>
<p>Operations Working Group</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In August the OpenStreetMap community will be coming together for our annual State of the Map conference, this year in Aizu-Wakamatsu, Japan. It is set to be an exciting three day event where mappers, programmers, practitioners, entrepreneurs, and policy makers will share their passion for OpenStreetMap.</p>
<p>We invite you to submit your session proposals for the 2017 State of the Map, by Sunday, 2nd April 2017.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.openstreetmap.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SotM2017_logo_blog.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-176627427" src="https://blog.openstreetmap.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SotM2017_logo_blog.jpg" alt="" width="590" height="383" srcset="https://blog.openstreetmap.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SotM2017_logo_blog.jpg 590w, https://blog.openstreetmap.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SotM2017_logo_blog-300x195.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" /></a></p>
<p>You are encouraged to submit proposals for <em>20 minute talks, 5 minute lightning talks</em>, and <em>75 minute workshops</em> that will result in progress and excitement in the world of OpenStreetMap. Again, <strong>the deadline is Sunday, 2nd April 2017</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfRMwL2ggH374BbEdgU_cVVLTpuszmyCLBDg0sqTXxRSOZUug/viewform">Apply here</a></p>
<p>In addition to <a href="http://2017.stateofthemap.org/">our website</a>, we are also delighted to introduce you to the logo for State of the Map 2017. Aizu-Wakamatsu is one of the historical cites in Tohoku district, Japan. As such the design contains elements inspired by the Tsuruga Castle, the circular emblems of feudal lords of Aizu Clan, and the letters “會津” that were used for Aizu during the Edo period. You can read more about the design <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/w/images/a/a3/SotM2017_Logo_Design_Concept.pdf">here</a>, and our thanks go to Shunnosuke Shimizu for the wonderful logo.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_176627413" style="width: 202px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-full wp-image-176627413" src="https://blog.openstreetmap.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gsoc_logo.png" alt="" width="192" height="192" srcset="https://blog.openstreetmap.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gsoc_logo.png 192w, https://blog.openstreetmap.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gsoc_logo-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 192px) 100vw, 192px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Google Summer of Code Logo (CC-BY-NC-ND 3.0 Google)</p></div>
<p>We&#8217;re now in preparation for our 10th Google Summer of Code. Over the years many students have participated and have continued to participate in the project beyond GSoC.</p>
<p>Organizations may apply to GSoC to become mentoring orgs until February 9th and of course we already did apply. However, we have to wait for February 27th to know if we&#8217;re accepted again. Student applications are due in April and the official coding period will be from May to July this year. For a full plan have a look at the <a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline">official timeline</a>.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re an interested student, don&#8217;t hesitate and start out today. It&#8217;s never too early to make yourself known to our great project and our great community. Our project is big and we have a very broad and diverse set of tasks, and project ideas which require an equally diverse set of skills. But one thing is quite common to all of them: You should learn about our database and how mapping is supposed to be performed. So grab yourself a bit of time and go out and start mapping. Add your local grocery store, your favorite clothes shop or that one bench you love to sit on. No matter what, it&#8217;s important to get yourself familiar with OpenStreetMap. Further than that, you can have a look at our <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code/2017/Project_Ideas">ideas&#8217; list</a> to see if there&#8217;s anything that you like and we&#8217;re also open to your own ideas. The best is to get on <a href="irc://irc.oftc.net/#osm-gsoc">IRC</a> or on our <a href="https://lists.openstreetmap.org/listinfo/dev">developers&#8217; mailing list</a> to introduce yourself and talk about what you want to work on.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a developer, please consider to add your good idea to our <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code/2017/Project_Ideas">ideas&#8217; list</a> or add yourself as a potential mentor for one of the proposed projects. We&#8217;re always seeking for backup admins, just in case. And if you are unsure whether your idea is good enough or if it&#8217;s feasible, you know where to find the GSoC admins. Just ask.</p>
<p>Finally, if you&#8217;re just interested about the Summer of Code, we have a <a href="https://blog.openstreetmap.org/2016/02/10/gsoc-2015/">detailed recap</a> of 2015&#8217;s GSoC, but also 2016 was a great success with a number of interesting projects and good students. In 2016 we had a total of six projects accepted, where four of them made it to the end.</p>
<p>Michael Zangl, a student from Germany, worked hard to reorganize the core of JOSM, our most widely used editor. He participated in 2015 as well, and he subscribed as a mentor for 2017. He wrote a <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code/2016/AcceptedProjects/JOSM_core">detailed summary</a> of his work and we&#8217;re happy to have him in our project and as a potential mentor this year.</p>
<p>Darya Golovko improved the JOSM Plugin for Public Transport (pt_assistant) i.e. by validating the public transport routes against a set of criteria, identifying errors and suggesting how to fix them. Her work is described in more detail <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code/2016/AcceptedProjects/PT_Assistant">here</a>. Darya was a great student and it was nice to have her at our <a href="https://blog.openstreetmap.org/2016/10/10/sotm-thanks/">annual international conference, State of the Map</a>.</p>
<p>Kushan Joshi applied for adding a visual lane editor to our javascript-based editor iD. Although he was very diligent, he didn&#8217;t complete the project as was initially planned, for no less reason than that he fixed several bugs, added features and worked on various other elements to make our editor iD even greater. As we valued his work very much, he passed last year&#8217;s Google Summer of Code without a question and you can read a detailed description of his work on <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/kepta/diary">his personal blog</a>. While he is continuing his study work, he&#8217;s still with our project and contributing code from time to time.</p>
<p>Last but not least there&#8217;s Zabot who continued the work on OSM2World, a well known 3D converter in OSM. Although it&#8217;s a hard task to get to know all this new technology with OpenGL and shaders he did an impressive work and added several new features to the rendering pipeline, so that you now have reflections on windows and water, colors and reflectance based on the time of day, ripples in water bodies, and multi-light rendering which allows you to have nice renderings at night with illumination coming from street lamps. Even though he didn&#8217;t stick with our project, his work is much appreciated and you can read more about it on his <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/Zabot/diary">personal diary</a>.</p>
<p>Reading all that you really should go out and have a look what you can do to help our project. We&#8217;re searching for you and your helping hand. And even without you being a student (in Google Summer of Code) we&#8217;ll greatly appreciate your help. Be it as a developer for a specific task or project idea or as a mapper to make our map even greater than it is already now.</p>
<p>Hope to see you soon.</p>
