    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Live from our servers, it&#39;s This Week in Rails!</p>

<p>As always we&#39;re your inside scoop of interesting commits, pull requests and more from <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails">Rails</a>.</p>

<p>This is <a href="https://twitter.com/kaspth">Kasper</a>, and I&#39;m ready to serve you this scoop. I tapped keys on the board in front of me to make words appear. It&#39;s quite the tapestry.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s get to it!</p>

<h2>Featured</h2>

<h3><a href="http://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/in-time-window/this-week">This week&#39;s Rails contributors</a></h3>

<p>33 contributors made this week happen. Pull Requests were merged, new friendships were made... I think I even heard someone say they saw a cat online. That&#39;s a rare sight, and part of what made this week special. Thanks everyone!</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/18448">Tokens in migrations and model generators</a></h3>

<p>As a follow up to last week&#39;s <code>has_secure_token</code>, both the migration and model generators can create <code>token</code> attributes.<br>
<code>rails g migration add_auth_token_to_users auth_token:token</code>. <code>rails g model user auth_token:token</code>.<br>
The model generator automatically adds <code>has_secure_token :auth_token</code> to your new model file.</p>

<h2>New Stuff</h2>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/0b2e0528df36bcef4aca62b86f55e1ea85604cd8"><code>method_source</code> added to the default Gemfile</a></h3>

<p>On Rails 5 when you generate a new app, you&#39;ll find &#39;method_source&#39; in your Gemfile. This gem extends the <code>Method</code> class with <code>source</code> and <code>comment</code> methods to aid your debugging. There&#39;s a good usage example in <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/18473#issuecomment-69682891">this comment</a>.</p>

<h2>Fixed</h2>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/18439">Allow &#39;1&#39; or true for acceptance validation</a></h3>

<p>Previously <code>validates_acceptance_of</code> would only accept &#39;1&#39; as a valid attribute value. Now you can assign <code>true</code> to an attribute and the validation will pass.</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/15726">Time columns will be aware of application time zone</a></h3>

<p>In Rails 5.1 your time columns will adhere to the time zone of your Rails application. To make the upgrade path smoother, the <code>config.active_record.time_zone_aware_types</code> option has been added. See the deprecation warning <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/5cd3bbbb832b58d2a0092f527d83312df4271de7/activerecord/lib/active_record/attribute_methods/time_zone_conversion.rb#L74-L86">here</a> for help.</p>

<h2>One More Thing™</h2>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/18454">Validation callbacks tested with contexts</a></h3>

<p>A feature you might not have heard about is validation contexts, which allow you to specify a context a callback should only be run for. Like this: <code>before_validation callback, on: :create</code>. The link shows a few tests being for this on <code>before/after_validation</code>. <a href="https://gist.github.com/dhh/9672827">Here</a> is a more advanced example.</p>

<h2>Wrapping up</h2>

<p>That&#39;s all for <em>This week in Rails</em>. As always, there are more changes than we have room to cover here, but feel free to <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails">check them out</a> yourself!</p>

<p>P.S. If you enjoyed this newsletter, why not <a href="http://rails-weekly.goodbits.io">share it with your friends</a>? :) If you wish to be part of this project please don&#39;t hesitate to contact <a href="mailto:godfrey@brewhouse.io">Godfrey</a> – there&#39;re a lot of ways you could help make this newsletter more awesome!</p>

    <id>http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2015/1/10/This-week-in-Rails/</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Happy New Year, everyone!</p>

<p>It was only less than a year ago when I sent the <a href="http://us3.campaign-archive1.com/?u=2721e27ce456363785acc5405&amp;id=d1b48a0b9d">first issue</a> of
<a href="http://rails-weekly.goodbits.io"><em>This week in Rails</em></a> to a total of 14 recipients, discussing some
of the latest and greatest additions to the Rails codebase.</p>

<p>43 weeks later, this little hobby project has <a href="http://brewhouse.io/blog/2014/04/24/this-week-in-rails-the-backstory.html">evolved</a> into a true
community effort –- we have assembled an <a href="https://twitter.com/kaspth">amazing</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/gregmolnar">team</a> of
<a href="https://twitter.com/huoxito">editors</a> and other volunteers (<a href="mailto:godfrey@brewhouse.io">join us!</a>), keeping
2000 subscribers in the loop and highlighting some key contributions to our
beloved web framework every week.</p>

<p>I am incredibly excited to announce that starting this week, we will be cross-
posting the content from the newsletter to the <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org">Riding Rails blog</a>. With
this, we hope to reach even more members of our wonderful community, increase
transparency, involve more of you in the decision-making processes and maybe
even inspire some future contributors!</p>

<p>I would like to thank my team at <a href="http://brewhouse.io">Brewhouse</a> and <a href="http://goodbits.io">Goodbits</a>
for supporting the project and getting it off the ground, as well as all the
volunteers who helped along the way. Of course, huge thank you to all of the
<a href="http://contributors.rubyonrails.org">Rails contributors</a> who did all the hard work! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3</p>

<p>Without further ado, here is the first 2015 issue of <em>This week in Rails</em>!</p>

<hr>

<p>Welcome to <em>This week in Rails</em>, your weekly inside scoop of interesting commits, pull requests and more from <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails">Rails</a>.</p>

<p>Hi there this is <a href="https://twitter.com/huoxito">Washington</a> again!</p>

<p>Hope you all had the most gorgeous holidays ever doing things you love the most. The newsletter team is back to work and you should receive your Rails weekly news as usual. Here are some of the latest and greatest improvements, fixes and releases during the break.</p>

<h2>Featured</h2>

<h3><a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2014/12/25/ruby-2-2-0-released/">Ruby 2.2.0 Released</a></h3>

<p>YAY! December 25th saw another important Ruby release. See the blog post for all the goodies in this new version and keep in mind Rails 5 will target Ruby 2.2+ exclusively. As of this week, Rails&#39; master branch will only work on Ruby 2.2 or above.</p>

<h3><a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2015/1/6/Rails-4-1-9-and-4-0-13-have-been-released/">Rails 4.0.13 and 4.1.9 have been released!</a></h3>

<p>4.0.13 is last planned release for the 4.0 release series, so you should migrate off it as soon as possible. From here on, the 4.1 (you can thank <a href="https://github.com/rafaelfranca">Rafael</a>) and 4.2 release series will continue to receive regular bug fixes. Consult the <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/maintenance_policy.html">maintenance policy</a> for details.</p>

<h3><a href="http://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/in-time-window/this-week">This week&#39;s Rails Contributors</a></h3>

<p>Apparently holidays is no excuse for going to the beach all day long and having drinks away from computers. Rails community kept working hard during the break to keep improving the framework we appreciate so much. Thank you all!</p>

<h2>New Stuff</h2>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/17227">Halting callback chains by throwing :abort</a></h3>

<p>As of Rails 5 callback chains won&#39;t be halted by returning <code>false</code>. Instead you should explicitly <code>throw :abort</code>. This will help keep things consistent among all frameworks included in Rails and avoid accidental halting caused by unexpected <code>false</code> return values.</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/18335">New date helper</a></h3>

<p>Working with days and weeks just got a bit easier. Keep in mind these new helpers <code>on_weekend?</code>, <code>next_weekday</code>, <code>prev_weekday</code>, <code>next_day</code>, <code>prev_day</code>. Perhaps you had even implemented them before yourself! Good thing Rails will have them out of the box now :)</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/18217"><code>has_secure_token</code> in Active Record</a></h3>

<p>Rails will ship with a new Active Record macro for generating <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/18347">base 58</a> tokens out of the box. There&#39;s probably a large amount of applications already using this feature. As of the next major release you won&#39;t need to add another dependency or implement it yourself.</p>

<h2>Fixed</h2>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/18074">More conventional filenames for mailers</a></h3>

<p>Mailer generators now appends the <code>_mailer</code> suffix in the filename just like controller and jobs generators.</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/18325">Rails 5.0 deprecations clean up</a></h3>

<p>This week Rails got some more love with this major clean up (339 additions and 1,433 deletions) on its master branch. There&#39;s still some deprecations left though as the team figures how to best address them.</p>

<h2>One More Thing™</h2>

<h3><a href="https://twitter.com/sgrif/status/548645759856300033">Automatic type casting deprecated in Arel</a></h3>

<p>Watch out library authors! Sean Griffin put a lot of effort into improving Arel extensibility. Please get in touch with him if you need APIs to help your use case. (See also these <a href="https://github.com/rails/arel/commit/6160bfbda1d1781c3b08a33ec4955f170e95be11">follow-up</a> <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/compare/266ff700011d...f916aa247bdd">commits</a>.)</p>

<h2>Wrapping up</h2>

<p>That&#39;s all for <em>This week in Rails</em>. As always, there are more changes than we have room to cover here, but feel free to <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails">check them out</a> yourself!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hi everyone,</p>

<p>I am happy to announce that Rails 4.1.9 and 4.0.13 have been released.</p>

<p>This will be also the last release of 4.0 series as announced
<a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2014/9/12/Rails-4-1-6-and-4-0-10-has-been-released/">in a previous blog post</a>.</p>

<p>As per our maintenance policy, the release of Rails 4.2.0 means bug fixes will only apply to 4-2-stable,
regular security issues to 4.2.x, 4.1.x, and severe security issues to 4.2.x, 4.1.x, and 3.2.x.
In addition to these already stated commitments, I agreed to also apply bug fixes to 4-1-stable
until the Rails 5 release.</p>

<p>As before, we will announce in a future blog post when we will drop bug fixes support
for Rails 4.1.</p>

    <title>Rails 4.2: Active Job, Asynchronous Mails, Adequate Record, Web Console, Foreign Keys</title>
    <author>
      <name>dhh</name>
    </author>
    <link href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2014/12/19/Rails-4-2-final/"/>
    <updated>2014-12-19T21:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2014/12/19/Rails-4-2-final/</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We come bearing gifts! It&#39;s Rails 4.2, and the final version is ready just in time for Christmas. It&#39;s full of great toys, useful gizmos, and polished edges, courtesy of a fantastic community of merry elves who&#39;ve been coding away with jolly glee for months.</p>

<p>This is probably also the most well-tested new major release of Rails in a long time. Through four betas and three release candidates, tons of people have helped ensure that regressions and bugs have been caught. Since the first beta, we have some 1600+ commits of spit and polish applied. So you have good reason to be excited!</p>

<p>To recap, here&#39;s a walkthrough of the major new goodies:</p>

<h2>Active Job, ActionMailer #deliver_later</h2>

<p>The headline feature for Rails 4.2 is the brand new Active Job framework, and its integrations. Active Job is an adapter layer on top of queuing systems like <a href="https://github.com/resque/resque">Resque</a>, <a href="https://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job">Delayed Job</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq">Sidekiq</a>, and <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveJob/QueueAdapters.html">more</a>. You can write your jobs to Active Job, and they&#39;ll run on all these queues with no changes.</p>

<p>With an always-configured queue in place (though the default is just an <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveJob/QueueAdapters/InlineAdapter.html">inline runner</a>), we can build on top of that where it makes sense. And the first place it makes sense is to send Action Mailer emails asynchronously. So we&#39;re introducing the <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionMailer/MessageDelivery.html#method-i-deliver_later">#deliver_later</a> method, which will do just that: Add your email to be sent as a job to a queue, so you don&#39;t bog down the controller or model. Voila!</p>

<p>The cherry on top is our new <a href="https://github.com/rails/globalid">GlobalID</a> library. It makes it easy to pass Active Record objects to jobs by serializing them in a generic form. This means you no longer have to manually pack and unpack your Active Records by passing ids. Just give the job the straight AR object, and it&#39;ll serialize it using GlobalID, and deserialize it at run time. So much easier!</p>

<p>Special thanks go out to <a href="https://github.com/cristianbica">Cristian Bica</a> and <a href="https://github.com/seuros">Abdelkader Boudih</a> for their outstanding work bringing this trinity of improvements to Rails!</p>

<h2>Adequate Record</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/tenderlove">Aaron Patterson</a> is always hunting for performance bounties in Rails, and with an improvement project called <a href="http://tenderlovemaking.com/2014/02/19/adequaterecord-pro-like-activerecord.html">Adequate Record</a> for Active Record, he&#39;s come up good. A lot of common queries are now no less than twice as fast in Rails 4.2! This is a great step forward for performance. While computers are constantly getting cheaper and performance is improving, nobody ever said &quot;hey, get that free speed out of my framework&quot;. So there you go: Some free speed, buddy!</p>

<h2>Web Console</h2>

<p>Out of the wonderful <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2014/5/23/meet-our-google-summer-of-code-students-and-mentors/">Google Summer of Code</a> for Rails campaign comes <a href="https://github.com/rails/web-console">Web Console</a>, which gives you a development console to inspect the state of affairs on all exception pages! It even allows you to jump between the different points in the backtrace, and you&#39;ll be able to inspect things right at that point.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a wonderful improvement to the debugging workflow. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/gsamokovarov">Genadi Samokovarov</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ryandao">Ryan Dao</a> for their work on this project.</p>

<h2>Foreign Keys</h2>

<p>Rails has long had a tumultuous relationship with foreign keys, but the drama days are now over. If you want to have foreign keys, you can have foreign keys, and Rails will still smile as it takes your order. The migration DSL gets <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/ConnectionAdapters/SchemaStatements.html#method-i-add_foreign_key">add_foreign_key</a> and <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/ConnectionAdapters/SchemaStatements.html#method-i-remove_foreign_key">remove_foreign_key</a> and the standard schema.rb dumper will support maintaing these declarations. Foreign key support starts out as an exclusive to the MySQL and PostgreSQL adapters.</p>

<h2>And so much more...</h2>

<p>The above are just the highlights. We have many more goodies packed into this release than that. You can read a great summary in the <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/4_2_release_notes.html">release notes</a>. </p>

<h2>Maintenance consequences and Rails 5.0!</h2>

<p>As per our <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/maintenance_policy.html">maintenance policy</a>, the release of Rails 4.2 means bug fixes will only apply to 4-2-stable, regular security issues to 4.2.x, 4.1.x, and severe security issues to 4.2.x, 4.1.x, and 3.2.x. In addition to these already stated commitments, the honorable <a href="https://github.com/rafaelfranca">Rafael França</a> has agreed to also apply bug fixes to 4-1-stable. So everyone still on 4.1 and unable to move quickly can thank Rafael!</p>

<p>Rails 4.2 also marks the last big release in the 4.x series. With this release out, we&#39;re now working towards the big Rails 5.0! This means rails/master is now targeting 5.0.</p>

<p>Rails 5.0 will target Ruby 2.2+ exclusively. There are a bunch of optimizations coming in Ruby 2.2 that are going to be very nice, but most importantly for Rails, symbols are going to be garbage collected. This means we can shed a lot of weight related to juggling strings when we accept input from the outside world. It also means that we can convert fully to keyword arguments and all the other good stuff from the latest Ruby.</p>

<p>The release target for Rails 5.0 is currently Fall of 2015. So there&#39;s a while yet, but we&#39;re putting this out there for people to know, so gem maintainers and other Ruby implementations can know where we&#39;re going. We&#39;ll be working on putting out somewhat of a road map for the features when that&#39;s become a bit clearer.</p>

<h2>Thanks to all and happy holidays!</h2>

<p>It continues to be a pleasure and an honor to be involved with the amazing Ruby on Rails community – both <a href="http://contributors.rubyonrails.org/releases/4-2-0/contributors">contributors</a> and users. The collaboration and resulting quality has never been better. Have a great holiday season and New Year&#39;s, and we&#39;ll see you all with more delicious releases in 2015!</p>

    <title>Rails 4.0.11.1 and 4.1.7.1 have been released</title>
    <author>

    <id>http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2014/11/19/Rails-4-0-11-1-and-4-1-7-1-have-been-released/</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hi everyone!</p>

<p>Rails 4.0.11.1 and 4.1.7.1 have been released!</p>

<p>These two releases contain only security fix that was already released as 4.0.12 and 4.1.8.
You can read more about the issue <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rubyonrails-security/rMTQy4oRCGk">here (CVE-2014-7829)</a>.</p>

<p>4.0.12 and 4.1.8 were inadvertently based on their respective stable branches, and so incorporated
additional changes beyond those necessary to resolve the security issue. In keeping with our security
policy, it is our intention to include only the minimum necessary changes in security releases, to
ensure everyone can upgrade without fear of regressions. As those releases included unrelated changes,
we are providing new releases, based on the previous release, which contain only the security fix
itself.</p>

<p>If you have already successfully upgraded to 4.0.12 or 4.1.8, no further action is required.
Otherwise, if you are still on 4.0.11 or 4.1.7, please do upgrade to 4.0.11.1 or 4.1.7.1 at your
earliest convenience.</p>

<p>The 3.2.21 release did incorporate a second change, but that change was intended: by policy, minor
security-relevant bugs (which do not independently warrant a security release) are occasionally
backported to 3-2-stable, and rolled into a subsequent security release.</p>

<p>The commits for 4.0.11.1 can be found <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/compare/v4.0.11...v4.0.11.1">here</a>,
and the commits for 4.1.7.1 can be found <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/compare/v4.1.7...v4.1.7.1">here</a>.</p>

<p>I would like to announce that Rails 3.2.21, 4.0.12, and 4.1.8 have been released.  These releases contain a security fix where the existence of arbitrary files on the file system can be leaked, but the contents of the file <strong>will not</strong> be leaked.  The issue generally only impacts people who are using Rails to serve static assets, and will generally not impact people who use a proxy to serve static assets.  This issue is similar to CVE-2014-7818, but is slightly different.

<p>In addition to the security fixes in <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/rails/versions/4.2.0.beta3">4.2.0.beta3</a>,
this new release includes a number of bug fixes for issues reported since the
<a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/rails/versions/4.2.0.beta2">4.2.0.beta2</a> release.</p>

<p>If all goes according to plan, this should be the last beta release for 4.2.0
before we move into the Release Candidates phase. We would like to thank all
of the early adopters who participated in the beta testing and reported issues,
as well as the 64 contributors who submitted patches to help our team address
these bugs.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello everyone!!! It&#39;s that time again.</p>

<p>I would like to announce that Rails 3.2.20, 4.0.11, 4.1.7, and 4.2.0.beta3 have been released.  These releases contain a security fix where the existence of arbitrary files on the file system can be leaked, but the contents of the file <strong>will not</strong> be leaked.  The issue generally only impacts people who are using Rails to serve static assets, and will generally not impact people who use a proxy to serve static assets.  You can read more about the issue <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rubyonrails-security/dCp7duBiQgo">here (CVE-2014-7818)</a>.  A release of sprockets has also been made to help with this issue.  You can read about it <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rubyonrails-security/doAVp0YaTqY">here (CVE-2014-7819)</a>.</p>

<p>For ease of upgrading, the only changes in these releases are the security fixes.</p>

<p>Here are the checksums for the gems:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Happy Monday everyone!</p>

<p>Today the Rails team is happy to announce that we have released Rails
<a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/rails/versions/4.2.0.beta2">4.2.0.beta2</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks to all the early adopters who have participated in the first round of
beta testing, we have identified a number of bugs, regressions and other
imperfections in the codebase. These problems have since been fixed and included
in this release.</p>

<h2>Security Issues</h2>

<p>This release also includes two security patches.</p>

<h3>Web Console 2.0.0.beta4</h3>

<p>Along with the Rails 4.2.0.beta2 release we also released Web Console <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/web-console/versions/2.0.0.beta4">2.0.0.beta4</a>
which includes a security fix.</p>

<p>If you are already using Web Console in development we recommend you to upgrade
to this new version of the gem.</p>

<h3>Active Job vulnerability</h3>

<p>We also fixed an Active Job bug that allowed String arguments to be deserialized
as if they were Global IDs, an object injection security vulnerability.</p>

<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>

<p>In addition to the security and bug fixes, some of the new APIs have also been
refined after further testing in real-world applications. This resulted in the
following list of breaking changes that are not backwards-compatible with
4.2.0.beta1:</p>

<h3>Active Job</h3>

<p>The Active Job API has been overhauled:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"># The enqueueing method has changed from +enqueue+ to +perform_later+.
#
# In 4.2.0.beta1:
MyJob.enqueue(*args)
#
# In 4.2.0.beta2:
MyJob.perform_later(*args)

# The ways jobs are scheduled has changed.
#
# In 4.2.0.beta1:
MyJob.enqueue_at(Date.tomorrow.noon, record)
MyJob.enqueue_in(1.week, record)
#
# In 4.2.0.beta2:
MyJob.set(wait_until: Date.tomorrow.noon).perform_later(record)
MyJob.set(wait: 1.week).perform_later(record)
#
# You can also specify a queue to enqueue the job onto with this new API:
MyJob.set(queue: :low_priority).perform_later(record)
</code></pre></div>
<h3>Action Mailer</h3>

<p>The Action Mailer API has also undergone some changes:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"># Two new methods +#deliver_now+ and +#deliver_now!+ were introduced for
# clarity. +#deliver+ and +#deliver!+ have been deprecated and applications are
# encouraged to use the +#deliver_*+ instead.
#
# In 4.2.0.beta1:
Notifier.welcome(User.first).deliver!
#
# In 4.2.0.beta2:
Notifier.welcome(User.first).deliver_now!

# The options for +#deliver_later+ and +#deliver_later!+ has changed to match
# those on Active Job.
#
# In 4.2.0.beta1:
Notifier.welcome(User.first).deliver_later!(in: 1.hour)
Notifier.welcome(User.first).deliver_later!(at: 10.hours.from_now)
#
# In 4.2.0.beta2:
Notifier.welcome(User.first).deliver_later!(wait: 1.hour)
Notifier.welcome(User.first).deliver_later!(wait_until: 10.hours.from_now)
</code></pre></div>
<h3>Action Controller <code>render</code> behavior change</h3>

<p>Historically, calling <code>render &quot;foo/bar&quot;</code> in a controller action is equivalent
to calling <code>render file: &quot;foo/bar&quot;</code>. Since beta 2, this has been changed to mean
<code>render template: &quot;foo/bar&quot;</code> instead. This is due to a number of potential
security issues with the old default behavior. If you need to render a file,
please change your code to use the explicit form (<code>render file: &quot;foo/bar&quot;</code>)
instead.</p>

<h2>Full list of changes</h2>

<a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/compare/v4.2.0.beta1...v4.2.0.beta2">full list of changes</a>
that were included in this release.</p>

<h2>Acknowledgement</h2>

<p>The Rails team would like to thank the 66 people who contributed patches to make
this release possible!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/core/">Rails core team</a> has just accepted Yves &quot;Senny&quot; Senn and Godfrey Chan into its ranks. </p>

<p>Yves had his first patch committed to Rails back in 2011 and has since <a href="http://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/yves-senn/commits">racked up 1256 commits</a> of improvements to the framework. He&#39;s a developer with <a href="https://www.4teamwork.ch">4teamwork</a> from Bern, Switzerland, and we couldn&#39;t be happier to recognize his great work by admission to Rails core!</p>

<p>Godfrey Chan has been on a tear this year to help making everything Rails better. A lot of work and commits and reviews have come from Chan to ensure Rails 4.2 is the best it can be. He had his first commit in 2012, and has since <a href="http://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/godfrey-chan/commits">racked up another 255</a>. Welcome as well!</p>

<p>Finally, Yehuda Katz is retiring from active core participation and will join the hallowed halls of the <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/core/alumni/">Rails alumni</a>. We thank him dearly for all he has done to improve Rails and Ruby. It&#39;s been a pleasure to argue with him endlessly over things big and small, and doubt that&#39;s going to stop just because he&#39;s now alumni.</p>

<p>Thanks to Yves, Godfrey, and Yehuda, and to everyone else working on improving Rails, for their service. The community is grateful!</p>

    <title>Rails 4.2.0 beta1: Active Job, Deliver Later, Adequate Record, Web Console</title>
    <author>
      <name>dhh</name>
    </author>
    <link href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2014/8/20/Rails-4-2-beta1/"/>
    <updated>2014-08-20T03:30:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2014/8/20/Rails-4-2-beta1/</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We&#39;re putting the final touches on the first major new release of Rails in its second decade of life. While most software would be in a retirement home after a decade of operation, Rails has never been more fit, and this release is packed with goodies that&#39;ll make your work even easier, your apps even faster, and the whole experience even better.</p>

<h2>Active Job, ActionMailer #deliver_later</h2>

<p>The headline feature for Rails 4.2 is the brand new Active Job framework, and its integrations. Active Job is an adapter layer on top of queuing systems like <a href="https://github.com/resque/resque">Resque</a>, <a href="https://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job">Delayed Job</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq">Sidekiq</a>, and <a href="http://edgeapi.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveJob/QueueAdapters.html">more</a>. You can write your jobs to Active Job, and they&#39;ll run on all these queues with no changes.</p>

<p>With an always-configured queue in place (though the default is just an <a href="http://edgeapi.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveJob/QueueAdapters/InlineAdapter.html">inline runner</a>), we can build on top of that where it makes sense. And the first place it makes sense is to send Action Mailer emails asynchronously. So we&#39;re introducing the <a href="http://edgeapi.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionMailer/MessageDelivery.html#method-i-deliver_later">#deliver_later</a> method, which will do just that: Add your email to be sent as a job to a queue, so you don&#39;t bog down the controller or model. Voila!</p>

<p>The cherry on top is our new <a href="https://github.com/rails/globalid">GlobalID</a> library. It makes it easy to pass Active Record objects to jobs by serializing them in a generic form. This means you no longer have to manually pack and unpack your Active Records by passing ids. Just give the job the straight AR object, and it&#39;ll serialize it using GlobalID, and deserialize it at run time. So much easier!</p>

<p>Special thanks go out to <a href="https://github.com/cristianbica">Cristian Bica</a> and <a href="https://github.com/seuros">Abdelkader Boudih</a> for their outstanding work bringing this trinity of improvements to Rails!</p>

<h2>Adequate Record</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/tenderlove">Aaron Patterson</a> is always hunting for performance bounties in Rails, and with an improvement project called <a href="http://tenderlovemaking.com/2014/02/19/adequaterecord-pro-like-activerecord.html">Adequate Record</a> for Active Record, he&#39;s come up good. A lot of common queries are now no less than twice as fast in Rails 4.2! This is a great step forward for performance. While computers are constantly getting cheaper and performance is improving, nobody ever said &quot;hey, get that free speed out of my framework&quot;. So there you go: Some free speed, buddy!</p>

<h2>Web Console</h2>

<p>Out of the wonderful <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2014/5/23/meet-our-google-summer-of-code-students-and-mentors/">Google Summer of Code</a> for Rails campaign comes <a href="https://github.com/rails/web-console">Web Console</a>. It&#39;s an IRB console available in the browser. In development mode, you can go to <code>/console</code> and do your work right there.</p>

<p>Now that&#39;s neat, but what&#39;s insanely useful is that this console is automatically available on all exception pages! So when something is bust, you&#39;ll now instantly be able to inspect the state of affairs. It even allows you to jump between the different points in the backtrace, and you&#39;ll be able to inspect things right at that point.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a wonderful improvement to the debugging workflow. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/gsamokovarov">Genadi Samokovarov</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ryandao">Ryan Dao</a> for their work on this project.</p>

<h2>Everything else</h2>

<p>Some quick highlights from the rest of all the wonder that is Rails 4.2:</p>

<ul>
<li>Template digests are now automatically included when calculating etags for caching. So caches are bust when the template changes.</li>
<li><code>respond_with</code> has moved out and into its own proper home with the <a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/responders">responders</a> gem.</li>
<li>Support for real foreign keys! <code>add_foreign_key</code>/<code>remove_foreign_key</code> are now available in migrations.</li>
<li>A ton of bug fixes and minor improvements to Active Record.</li>
<li>Added <code>config.x.whatever.you_want = true</code> for custom configuration of your app in <code>config/environments/*</code>, <code>config/application.rb</code>, and initializers.</li>
<li>Added <code>Rails::Application.config_for(:some_yaml)</code> to load YAML configurations store in <code>config/</code> easily.</li>
</ul>

<p>We&#39;re working on a set of <a href="http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/4_2_release_notes.html">preliminary release notes</a> too.</p>

<h2 id="maintenance-consequences-and-rails-5-0">Maintenance consequences and Rails 5.0!</h2>

<p>As per our <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/maintenance_policy.html">maintenance policy</a>, the release of Rails 4.2 will mean that bug fixes will only apply to 4-2-stable, regular security issues to 4.2.x, 4.1.x, and severe security issues to 4.2.x, 4.1.x, and 3.2.x. In addition to these already stated commitments, the honorable <a href="https://github.com/rafaelfranca">Rafael França</a> has agreed to also apply bug fixes to 4-1-stable. So everyone still on 4.1 and unable to move quickly can thank Rafael!</p>

<p>Rails 4.2 will also mark the last big release in the 4.x series. After release, we&#39;re going to work towards the big Rails 5.0! This means rails/master will have that target as soon as the release candidates for 4.2 start, and 4-2-stable is created.</p>

<p>Rails 5.0 is in most likelihood going to target Ruby 2.2. There&#39;s a bunch of optimizations coming in Ruby 2.2 that are going to be very nice, but most importantly for Rails, symbols are going to be garbage collected. This means we can shed a lot of weight related to juggling strings when we accept input from the outside world. It also means that we can convert fully to keyword arguments and all the other good stuff from the latest Ruby.</p>

<p>The release target for Rails 5.0 is currently spring/summer of 2015. So there&#39;s a while yet, but we&#39;re putting this out there for people to know, so gem maintainers and other Ruby implementations can know where we&#39;re going.</p>

<h2>Please help us make Rails 4.2 solid!</h2>

<p>We rely on the feedback from everyone in the community to flush out bugs and upgrade issues ahead of a big release like this. So please give Rails 4.2 a try on your app, and if you&#39;re starting a new app today, you should probably use the beta1 for that, if you&#39;re just the least bit savvy with Rails.</p>

<p>Issues can be recorded on the <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/issues">Github issues tracker</a>.</p>

<p>Already, <a href="http://contributors.rubyonrails.org/edge/contributors">476 people have contributed</a> to this new release of Rails. Please do become one of them!</p>
