		<description><![CDATA[<p><p>Model level caching is something that's often ignored, even by seasoned developers. Much of it's due to the misconception that, when you cache the views, you don't need to cache at the lower levels. While it's true that much of a bottleneck in the Rails world lies in the View layer, that's not always the case.</p>

<p>Lower level caches are very flexible and can work anywhere in the application. In this tutorial, I'll demonstrate how to cache your models with Redis.</p></p><p><em>Continue reading %<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sitepoint.com/rails-model-caching-redis/">Rails Model Caching with Redis</a>%</em></p>]]></description>

Since then, all sorts of solutions have sprung up to make this process a little bit less painful and tedious. One of the latest is called Tokaido and makes the installation a breeze. But, it abstracts away so much from the user that what Tokaido actually does on your system can be somewhat confusing for a beginner. In this article, we'll take a look at how to use Tokaido to get Ruby/Rails up and running, as well as what kind of stuff Tokaido brings along with it.</p></p><p><em>Continue reading %<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sitepoint.com/tokaido-quick-start-rails/">Tokaido: Quick Start with Rails</a>%</em></p>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<p><p>Mailboxer is a Rails gem that is a part of the <a href="https://github.com/ging/social_stream">social_stream</a> framework for building social networks. It is a generic messaging system that allows any model to act "messageable", equipping it with some versatile methods. With Mailboxer, you can create conversations with one or more recipients (messages are organized into folders - sentbox, inbox, trash) and send notifications via email. It is even possible to send messages between different models and add attachments! The only drawback is the lack of documentation, so I hope this post will be useful.</p></p><p><em>Continue reading %<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sitepoint.com/messaging-rails-mailboxer/">Messaging with Rails and Mailboxer</a>%</em></p>]]></description>

Much of how 2015 opens will, obviously, be based on the final words of 2014, so we'll start with some discussion of this year and try to extrapolate that into the future. Also, I am going to focus in on Ruby and Rails, more than anything else, mainly because it's what I know.</p></p><p><em>Continue reading %<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sitepoint.com/ruby-peek-2015/">A Peek at Ruby in 2015</a>%</em></p>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<p><p>Well, you've decided to learn Ruby, have you? That's great! Ruby is a wonderful language that aims to make programmers happy. Go for it! As you enter the world of Ruby he goes, you realize, "I need an editor". OK, Google, find me the best Ruby editor.</p>

<p>Holy smoke! There are a ton of editors, each with a community that swears by its features. "Use vim!" "Use Emacs!" "Use TextMate!" "Use Sublime Text!". You recoil in fear....what if you make the wrong choice???</p>

<p>This short story, which likely applied to many Rubyists, I decided to interview established Rubyists their best Ruby editor. If nothing else, this will show which editors are used by more Rubyists, with some data as to why. My hope is that it will serve as a guide for newcomers to Ruby, or possibly even those already working with Ruby, on which editors are popular.</p></p><p><em>Continue reading %<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sitepoint.com/editor-rubyists-use/">What Editor Do Rubyists Use?</a>%</em></p>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<p><p><em>We asked SitePoint authors what developer toys they would want for Christmas, then managed to source them — without relying on Santa.</em></p>

<p>When I started with Rails, I was introduced to something called “Test-Driven Development”. The theory is simple: write tests for your code, so that you can make changes to it with confidence.</p>

<h2 id="why-i-wanted-this-book">Why I wanted this book</h2>

<p>Initially, that sounded like a no-brainer, but when I tried putting it into practice I was assailed with questions and doubts: What do I test? Which tools should I use? Am I even doing it right?</p>

<p>Fast forward several years and the situation hasn’t become much better. Sure, I write tests for my code, but as my apps get more complex, the questions and doubts remain. That’s why “Rails 4 Test Prescriptions” by Noel Rappin was high on my Christmas wish list.</p>

<h2 id="the-experience-so-far">The experience so far</h2>

<p>The book doesn’t disappoint. It starts off slowly by covering the basics of testing each part of a Rails app, as well as using mocks, stubs and helpful gems such as webrat. It then gathers pace, moving on to more advanced topics such as testing the security of an app, testing external services (which always caused me headaches) and testing JavaScript.</p>

<p>In summary, although rather dry in places, this book contains something for every Rails developer. Whether it’s getting up to speed with unfamiliar tools, focusing on what to test, or choosing the right tools for the job, this is a veritable must-have for your coding toolbox.</p>

<p><em>What would you build with more knowledge of Test Driven Development? Answer in the comments, we’ll pick the best answer and send you a copy of the book!</em></p></p><p><em>Continue reading %<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sitepoint.com/want-christmas-rails-4-test-prescriptions/">All I Want for Christmas: Rails 4 Test Prescriptions</a>%</em></p>]]></description>
