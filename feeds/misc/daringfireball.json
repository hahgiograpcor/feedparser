If these devices wouldn&#8217;t start suddenly and incessantly\nbeeping, strangers wouldn&#8217;t lecture us to turn off our &#8220;cell\nphones&#8221; at the movie theater.</p>\n\n<p>In short, medical device manufacturers are stuck in a bygone era;\nthey continue to design these products in an engineering-driven,\nphysician-centered bubble. They have not yet grasped the concept\nthat medical devices are also life devices, and therefore need to\nfeel good and look good for the patients using them 24/7, in\naddition to keeping us alive.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(<a href=\"http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-10-22/features/sc-health-1020-diabetes-insulin-devic20101022_1_insulin-dependent-diabetics-high-blood-glucose-levels-blood-sugar\">Follow-up here in 2010</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>This was incredibly prescient, given the rumors <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/05/18/apple-watch-glucose\">that Apple is working on continuous non-invasive glucose monitoring</a> for Apple Watch. Jobs didn&#8217;t live to see it, but I think it&#8217;s exactly the sort of thing he would be pushing for if he were still alive.</p>\n\n<p>From chapter 37 of <a href=\"https://itun.es/us/QyFUz.l\">Walter Isaacson&#8217;s <em>Steve Jobs</em></a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Even when he was barely conscious, his strong personality came\nthrough. At one point the pulmonologist tried to put a mask over\nhis face when he was deeply sedated. Jobs ripped it off and\nmumbled that he hated the design and refused to wear it. Though\nbarely able to speak, he ordered them to bring five different\noptions for the mask and he would pick a design he liked. The\ndoctors looked at Powell, puzzled. She was finally able to\ndistract him so they could put on the mask. He also hated the\noxygen monitor they put on his finger. He told them it was ugly\nand too complex. He suggested ways it could be designed more\nsimply. “He was very attuned to every nuance of the environment\nand objects around him, and that drained him,” Powell recalled.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘10-Year-Old Open Letter Calling for Apple to Make Glucose Monitors’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/05/20/open-letter-apple-glucose\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t"

Google AMP is bad news\nfor how the web is built, it&#8217;s bad news for publishers of credible\nonline content, and it&#8217;s bad news for consumers of that content.\nGoogle AMP is only good for one party: Google. Google, and\npossibly, purveyors of fake news.</p>\n\n<p>It&#8217;s time for developers to wake up and, as Jason Scott <a href=\"http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/3086\">once said</a>\nof Facebook, stop: &#8220;Shoveling down the shit sherbet&#8221; Google is now\nserving with AMP.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/01/17/schreiber-amp\">I&#8217;m on the record</a> as being strongly opposed to AMP simply on the grounds of publication independence. I&#8217;d stand by that even if the implementation were great. But the implementation is not great &#8212; it&#8217;s terrible. Yes, AMP pages load fast, but you don&#8217;t need AMP for fast-loading web pages. If you are a publisher and your web pages don&#8217;t load fast, the sane solution is to <a href=\"http://idlewords.com/amp_static.html\">fix your fucking website so that pages load fast</a>, not to throw your hands up in the air and implement AMP.</p>\n\n<p>But other than loading fast, AMP <em>sucks</em>. It implements its own scrolling behavior on iOS, which feels unnatural, and even worse, it breaks the decade-old system-wide iOS behavior of being able to tap the status bar to scroll to the top of any scrollable view. AMP also completely breaks Safari&#8217;s ability to search for text on a page (via the &#8220;Find on Page&#8221; action in the sharing sheet). Google has no respect for the platform. If I had my way, Mobile Safari would refuse to render AMP pages. It&#8217;s a deliberate effort by Google to break the open web.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘Scott Gilbertson: &#8216;Kill Google AMP Before It Kills the Web&#8217;’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/05/20/gilbertson-amp\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t"

But the Global Seed Vault, buried\nin a mountain deep inside the Arctic circle, has been breached\nafter global warming produced extraordinary temperatures over the\nwinter, sending meltwater gushing into the entrance tunnel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The big takeaway from this should be that climate change truly is a threat to civilization. But, I have to say, that melting permafrost wasn&#8217;t taken into consideration during the design of this vault seems like a glaring oversight.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> Looks like The Guardian might have shamelessly sensationalized this story. <a href=\"http://www.popsci.com/seed-vault-flooding?src=SOC&amp;dom=tw#page-3\">Mary Beth Griggs, reporting for Popular Science</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“If there was a worst case scenario where there was so much water,\nor the pumping systems failed, that it made its way uphill to the\nseed vault, then it would encounter minus 18 [degrees celsius] and\nfreeze again. Then there’s another barrier [the ice] for entry\ninto the seed vault,” Fowler says. In other words, any water that\nfloods into the tunnel has to make it 100 meters downhill, then\nback uphill, then overwhelm the pumping systems, and then manage\nnot to freeze at well-below-freezing temperatures. Otherwise,\nthere&#8217;s no way liquid is getting into the seed bank &#8212; so the\nseeds are probably safe. [&#8230;]</p>\n\n<p>Still worried? Maybe this will help you exhale: “We did this\ncalculation; if all the ice in the world melted &#8212; Greenland,\nArctic, Antarctic, everything &#8212; and then we had the world&#8217;s\nlargest recorded tsunami right in front of the seed vault. So,\nvery high sea levels and the worlds largest Tsunami. What would\nhappen to the seed vault?” Fowler says. “We found that the seed\nvault was somewhere between a five and seven story building above\nthat point. It might not help the road leading up to the seed\nvault, but the seeds themselves would be OK.&#8221;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sounds like the vault itself <em>is</em> designed to survive a climate apocalypse &#8212; it&#8217;s just the entry that isn&#8217;t.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘Arctic Stronghold of World’s Seeds Flooded After Permafrost Melts’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/05/20/global-seed-vault\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t"

At 50, Apple’s design chieftain\nstill looks like the rugby player he once was, and he remains,\ndespite fame, fortune, and a knighthood, the same soft-spoken Brit\nI met almost 20 years ago. We are both wearing white hard hats\nwith a silver Apple logo above the brim; Ive’s is personalized\nwith “Jony” underneath the iconic symbol. Dan Whisenhunt, the\ncompany’s head of facilities and a de facto manager of the\nproject, comes with us. He too has a personalized hat. It is an\nactive construction site on a tight deadline &#8212; the first\noccupants are supposedly moving in within 30 days of my visit,\nwith 500 new employees arriving every week thereafter &#8212; and I\nfelt a bit like one of the passengers on the first ride into\nJurassic Park.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Fantastic piece. Hard not to get a little choked up thinking about it as Steve Jobs&#8217;s final product:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Could we have cut a corner here or there?” Cook asks\nrhetorically. “It wouldn’t have been Apple. And it wouldn’t have\nsent the message to everybody working here every day that detail\nmatters, that care matters.” That was what Jobs wanted &#8212; what he\nalways wanted. And the current leaders of Apple are determined\nnot to disappoint him in what is arguably his biggest, and is\ncertainly his last, product launch. “I revere him,” Cook says.\n“And this was clearly his vision, his concept. Our biggest\nproject ever.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘Steven Levy Tours Apple Park’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/05/16/levy-apple-park\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t"

I love thought exercises.</p>\n\n<p>My order (from first dropped to last):</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Facebook. I love Instagram, but could live without it. I don&#8217;t use anything else Facebook offers.</p></li>\n<li><p>Microsoft. The only Microsoft product I use regularly is Skype, for podcasting, and I suspect I could find another solution. (If I couldn&#8217;t, I might have to rethink my answer here.)</p></li>\n<li><p>Amazon. I buy stuff from Amazon almost every week. I just counted &#8212; 11 orders so far in 2017. My wife buys stuff from Amazon even more frequently. But just about anything we buy at Amazon, we <em>could</em> buy elsewhere. It&#8217;d be painful to replace, but not irreplaceable. There are a couple of shows exclusive to Amazon Prime that I enjoy, but none that I love.</p></li>\n<li><p>Alphabet. I already use DuckDuckGo as my default search engine, so giving up Google search would be frustrating at times, but not a deal breaker. I use a few email accounts backed by Gmail, but I actually dislike Gmail, and have been procrastinating on moving all my mail to <a href=\"https://www.fastmail.com/\">FastMail</a> for years. I despise Google Docs. I don&#8217;t use any Android devices other than as a curiosity. I greatly prefer Safari over Chrome. YouTube, however, is irreplaceable, and so essential that it pretty much singlehandedly catapults Alphabet to #4 in my list.</p></li>\n<li><p>Apple. I mean, come on. If not for Apple I&#8217;d be stuck using computers I don&#8217;t like and a phone that I consider a distant second-best. With all the other companies on the list, what I&#8217;d miss most are certain of their services &#8212; Instagram, Skype, Amazon&#8217;s store, YouTube &#8212; but Apple is the only company in the world whose hardware I consider irreplaceable. And you need the hardware to make best use of the services from any other companies.

         "content_html" : "\n<p><a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2017/apples-china-problem/\">Ben Thompson had a great column this week</a>, in the wake of Apple&#8217;s quarterly results and Microsoft&#8217;s announcement of the Surface Laptop:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Did you hear about the new Microsoft Surface Laptop? The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/reckless/status/859448810187235330\">usual\nsuspects</a> are claiming it’s a MacBook competitor, which is\ntrue insomuch as it is a laptop. In truth, though, the Surface\nLaptop isn’t a MacBook competitor at all for the rather obvious\nreason that it runs Windows, while the MacBook runs MacOS. This\nhas always been the foundation of Apple’s business model:\n<a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2016/everything-as-a-service/\">hardware differentiated by software</a> such that said hardware\ncan be sold with a margin much greater than nominal competitors\nrunning a commodity operating system.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Hardware differentiated by <em>superior, exclusive</em> software is the key to understanding Apple. It&#8217;s the reason the company was founded. Apple II&#8217;s were the best personal computer hardware <em>and</em> had the best software. Part of why Woz is so venerated is that he was unimaginably gifted at both hardware <em>and</em> <a href=\"http://gizmodo.com/how-steve-wozniak-wrote-basic-for-the-original-apple-fr-1570573636\">software</a>. Hardware differentiated by software is how Apple survived in the late &#8217;90s, when the company was struggling. It explains all the company&#8217;s success after that: the iPod, the resurgence of the Mac, iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. Any comparison between Microsoft&#8217;s Surface Laptop and Apple&#8217;s MacBooks that doesn&#8217;t place heavy emphasis on the value of MacOS is vapid.</p>\n\n<p>Thompson then turns to Apple&#8217;s languishing iPhone sales in China:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But that is not what is going on in most of the world: plenty of\nfolks &#8212; more than last year &#8212; are happy to buy the iPhone 7,\neven though it doesn’t look much different than the iPhone 6.\nAfter all, if you need a new phone, and you want iOS, you don’t\nhave much choice! Except, again, for China: that is the country\nwhere the appearance of the iPhone matters most; Apple’s\nproblem, though, is that in China that is the only thing that\nmatters at all.</p>\n\n<p>The fundamental issue is this: unlike the rest of the world, in\nChina the most important layer of the smartphone stack is not the\nphone’s operating system. Rather, it is WeChat. Connie Chan of\nAndreessen Horowitz <a href=\"http://a16z.com/2015/08/06/wechat-china-mobile-first/\">tried to explain in 2015</a> just how integrated\nWeChat is into the daily lives of nearly <a href=\"http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/5d6Th5wndmJT25cRHemZNg\">900 million Chinese</a>, and\nthat integration has only grown since then: every aspect of a\ntypical Chinese person’s life, not just online but also off is\nconducted through a single app (and, to the extent other apps are\nused, they are often games promoted through WeChat).</p>\n\n<p>There is nothing in any other country that is comparable: not\nLINE, not WhatsApp, not Facebook. All of those are about\ncommunication or wasting time: WeChat is that, but it is also for\nreading news, for hailing taxis, for paying for lunch (try and pay\nwith cash for lunch, and you’ll look like a luddite), for\naccessing government resources, for business. For all intents and\npurposes WeChat is your phone, and to a far greater extent in\nChina than anywhere else, your phone is everything.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As Thompson adds in a footnote, &#8220;Or, to put it another way, the operating system of China is WeChat, not iOS/Android.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Thompson cites a staggering statistic: among existing iPhone users in China who bought a new phone in 2016, only 50 percent of them bought another iPhone. That is an incredible statistical outlier compared to iPhone users in the rest of the world, where Apple&#8217;s retention rates hover around the mid-80s.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/iphone-users-abandon-loyalty-to-apple-2016-11\">Here&#8217;s a Business Insider report from November of last year</a>, with retention statistics from 2014 through 2016 from UBS analysts Steven Milunovich and Benjamin Wilson. Business Insider leads with the iPhone&#8217;s slowly declining retention rate globally, but the real story is halfway down the page, in <a href=\"http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/5818d4cbdd089533548b4991-1015/screen%20shot%202016-11-01%20at%2016.29.01.png\">this chart</a>.</p>\n\n<p>According to that research from UBS, iPhone retention rates hover in the mid-to-high 80s in the U.S., U.K., and Germany. In Japan they&#8217;re in the mid-70s, but holding roughly steady. China&#8217;s numbers have plummeted &#8212; and these numbers from UBS (in the mid-50s for Q4 2016) are in line with the 50 percent number in the Chinese survey Thompson cited.</p>\n\n<p>So here&#8217;s Apple&#8217;s China problem: Chinese iPhone users aren&#8217;t nearly as loyal to the iPhone platform as iPhone users elsewhere are. This is already hurting Apple financially. Apple&#8217;s Q2 2017 financial results (announced this week) were, overall, OK. But other than China, they were actually good. The drop in iPhone sales in China was so severe, and China is so big, that it singlehandedly turned a good quarter into a so-so quarter.</p>\n\n<p>I subtly disagree with Ben Thompson on one point. Thompson attributes the iPhone&#8217;s slide in China to two factors:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The whole &#8220;the operating system of China is WeChat, not iOS/Android&#8221; thing.</li>\n<li>The staleness of the iPhone 7 form factor.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Thompson knows Chinese culture well &#8212; he lives in Taipei, visits China often, and speaks Mandarin. My grasp of Chinese culture is rudimentary at best, and I&#8217;ve never traveled to Asia. So I defer to him on the point that the iPhone as a status symbol is more important in China than it is elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p>Thompson, though, I think places too much weight on the fact that at a glance, some models of the iPhone 7 are indistinguishable from the iPhone 6 and 6S. Thompson argues that this is more of a problem in status-conscious China than it is elsewhere &#8212; that in China, there are many people who forego an upgrade to an iPhone 7 because other people won&#8217;t be able to tell that it isn&#8217;t, say, a boring two-year-old iPhone 6. I just don&#8217;t buy that. For one thing, the black and especially jet black iPhone 7 models <em>are</em> instantly recognizable as the latest and greatest.</p>\n\n<p>But more importantly, I just think the whole &#8220;<em>if it doesn&#8217;t have an altogether new form factor, it&#8217;s boring</em>&#8221; thing is hogwash. <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/2016/09/design_as_branding\">I wrote an entire column about this</a> when the iPhone 7 debuted, and won&#8217;t rehash the whole argument here. But I am convinced this viewpoint is mostly that of the tech and gadget obsessed.</p>\n\n<p>Again, I&#8217;ll concede that the status symbol aspect of a high-end smartphone may well be more important in China than anywhere else in the world. But even if I also concede that the iPhone 7&#8217;s mostly-like-the-iPhone-6 form factor is a problem for the Chinese market, if the iOS platform engendered the loyalty in China that it does elsewhere, the result would be Chinese iPhone owners waiting another year for the <em>next</em> iPhone. Instead, according to the market research cited above, half of the Chinese iPhone owners who bought a new phone in 2016 switched to an Android device. There are some fine looking Android phones at the high end of the market, but there are none that, based on form factor alone, would explain this. And none of them have anything close to the luxury brand prestige that Apple does.</p>\n\n<p>In Apple&#8217;s &#8220;hardware differentiated by software&#8221; formula, the software is more important than the hardware. That&#8217;s why gadget writers so often get Apple wrong: they&#8217;re focused solely on hardware &#8212; the object, not the experience of using the object. That&#8217;s also why the financial press so often gets Apple wrong: they focus only on the hardware because that&#8217;s where the money comes from.</p>\n\n<p>If forced to choose, I would much rather run iOS on a Google Pixel than Android on an iPhone 7. I would rather run MacOS on a ThinkPad than Windows on a MacBook Pro.<sup id=\"fnr1-2017-05-05\"><a href=\"#fn1-2017-05-05\">1</a></sup> Whenever I bring up this thought experiment &#8212; would you rather run Apple&#8217;s software platform on non-Apple hardware or run some other software platform on Apple hardware &#8212; I get email from readers who say they actually do choose Apple products, especially MacBooks, for the hardware. I believe them, but those are the sort of customers with the least loyalty to Apple. If all you depend on is, say, Chrome, a text editor, and a terminal, it&#8217;s easy to switch to another laptop brand. If you depend on native Mac and iOS apps, iCloud, and iMessage, it&#8217;s arduous, at best, to switch.</p>\n\n<p>If it really is true that &#8220;the operating system of China is WeChat, not iOS/Android&#8221;, that&#8217;s the whole ballgame right there. Again, my disagreement with Thompson here is subtle. He even describes WeChat&#8217;s centrality to the Chinese smartphone stack as &#8220;the fundamental issue&#8221;, leaving the supposed boringness of the iPhone 6S and 7 as a secondary issue. My difference with Thompson is that I don&#8217;t think the iPhone 6S/7 hardware is a problem at all. Personally, I think the iPhone 7 is such a great phone, and the 7 Plus in particular has such a great camera, that the quality of the latest iPhone hardware, including how it looks, shows just how much of a problem it is that WeChat, not iOS, is central to the iPhone experience in China.</p>\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a real problem for Apple, because even if Thompson is right (and I&#8217;m wrong) and Apple <em>does</em> have a boring-looking-hardware problem in China, they can (and seem poised to) remedy that by releasing exciting new iPhone hardware this year. But if the problem is that iOS engenders far less platform loyalty in China because of WeChat&#8217;s centrality &#8212; or even worse, if WeChat is central <em>and</em> better on Android than it is on iOS &#8212; there&#8217;s no easy fix for Apple.</p>\n\n<h2>Postscript</h2>\n\n<p>For those of you like me, who know very little about WeChat, this 2015 piece by Connie Chan (as linked to by Thompson) is a terrific introduction: &#8220;<a href=\"http://a16z.com/2015/08/06/wechat-china-mobile-first/\">When One App Rules Them All: The Case of WeChat and Mobile in China</a>&#8221;.</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn1-2017-05-05\">\n<p>I always use ThinkPads as my go-to example of high-quality PC hardware; perhaps I should start using Microsoft Surfaces?&nbsp;<a href=\"#fnr1-2017-05-05\"  class=\"footnoteBackLink\"  title=\"Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.\">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n\n\n\n    "

Apple has never shared hard numbers on how many\nwearables it has sold, and doesn’t even break out Watch sales in\nits quarterly earnings report. Instead, the device is bundled into\nApple’s “Other products,” which the company says includes, “Apple\nTV, Apple Watch, Beats products, iPod and Apple-branded and\nthird-party accessories.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>These articles come out like clockwork every 3 months, as Apple&#8217;s earnings report draws near. Apple told us they were not going to report hard numbers on Apple Watch right from the start, six months before it shipped. They want to keep them secret for competitive reasons.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Two years and two iterations after its launch, the Apple Watch has\nnot proven to be as indispensable as the iPhone, or even as\nlucrative as the Mac, the iPad, or Apple’s services businesses.\nIt’s unclear whether an iPhone-like overhaul, or attempts to\nmarket the watch directly to athletes or millennials, will\nultimately make a difference.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(&#8220;Two years and two iterations after its launch&#8221; &#8212; I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s a mistake, if Murphy is counting WatchOS releases, or if he&#8217;s counting Series 1 as a full hardware iteration. But it&#8217;s sloppy writing. Most people would surely agree that there&#8217;s been only one iteration since launch, the Series 2 watches released last September.)</p>\n\n<p>The nut of every &#8220;Apple Watch is a dud&#8221; story is the fact that it&#8217;s clearly not an iPhone-size business. But that can&#8217;t be the only measure of success. The iPhone is the biggest and most successful consumer product in the history of the world. Nothing compares to the smartphone market, and it&#8217;s possible nothing else will in our lifetimes. You and I may never again see a product as profitable as the iPhone &#8212; not just from Apple, but from any company in any industry. Or maybe we will. It&#8217;s a complete unknown.</p>\n\n<p>But if Apple gets it into its head that they should only work on iPhone-sized opportunities, it would paralyze the company. In baseball terms, it&#8217;s fine for Apple to hit a bunch of singles while waiting for their next home run. According to Apple, <a href=\"https://www.wareable.com/apple/watch-sales-rolex-tim-cook-556\">they had more watch sales by revenue in 2015 than any company other than Rolex</a>, and Apple&#8217;s &#8220;Other&#8221; category, which is where Watch sales are accounted for, <a href=\"https://images.apple.com/pr/pdf/q1fy17datasum.pdf\">had a near record-breaking holiday quarter</a> three months ago, suggesting strongly that Watch sales were up over the year-ago holiday quarter.</p>\n\n<p>These two facts are both true: Apple Watch sales are a rounding error compared to the iPhone, and Apple Watch is a smash hit compared to traditional watches and other wearable devices.</p>\n\n\n\n    "

         "content_html" : "\n<p><a href=\"https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/04/23/technology/travis-kalanick-pushes-uber-and-himself-to-the-precipice.html\">Mike Isaac&#8217;s profile of Uber CEO Travis Kalanick for The New York Times</a> contains an accusation that, on its face, sounds outrageous:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For months, Mr. Kalanick had pulled a fast one on Apple by\ndirecting his employees to help camouflage the ride-hailing app\nfrom Apple’s engineers. The reason? So Apple would not find out\nthat Uber had been secretly identifying and tagging iPhones even\nafter its app had been deleted and the devices erased &#8212; a fraud\ndetection maneuver that violated Apple’s privacy guidelines.</p>\n\n<p>But Apple was on to the deception, and when Mr. Kalanick arrived\nat the midafternoon meeting sporting his favorite pair of bright\nred sneakers and hot-pink socks, Mr. Cook was prepared. “So, I’ve\nheard you’ve been breaking some of our rules,” Mr. Cook said in\nhis calm, Southern tone. Stop the trickery, Mr. Cook then\ndemanded, or Uber’s app would be kicked out of Apple’s App Store.</p>\n\n<p>For Mr. Kalanick, the moment was fraught with tension. If Uber’s\napp was yanked from the App Store, it would lose access to\nmillions of iPhone customers &#8212; essentially destroying the\nride-hailing company’s business. So Mr. Kalanick acceded.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&#8220;Secretly identifying and tagging iPhones even after its app had been deleted and the devices erased&#8221; is a rather startling accusation, because it sounds like it should be technically impossible. It&#8217;s also very much unclear what information Uber was able to glean from these &#8220;identified and tagged&#8221; iPhones other than some sort of unique device identifier. Unfortunately, the Times story is very short on details here. But note that the Times is <em>not</em> saying Uber was &#8220;tracking&#8221; these phones. A lot of people are jumping to the conclusion that Uber was somehow tracking the location of users even after they deleted the Uber app, but the word &#8220;track&#8221; only appears in the article in the context of Kalanick having &#8220;excelled at running track and playing football&#8221; in high school.</p>\n\n<p>[<strong>Update:</strong> This explains a lot, regarding the hubbub today over this story. <a href=\"http://newsdiffs.org/diff/1383350/1383404/https%3A/www.nytimes.com/2017/04/23/technology/travis-kalanick-pushes-uber-and-himself-to-the-precipice.html\">When first published, the Times story <em>did</em> use the word &#8220;tracking&#8221;</a>, but a subsequent revision changed that word to &#8220;identifying and tagging&#8221;.]</p>\n\n<p>Reading between the lines, it is possible &#8212; and my gut says quite probable &#8212; that Uber wasn&#8217;t <em>doing</em> anything on these iPhones other than when its app was installed and running on them. From the end of the article:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The idea of fooling Apple, the main distributor of Uber’s app,\nbegan in 2014.</p>\n\n<p>At the time, Uber was dealing with widespread account fraud in\nplaces like China, where tricksters bought stolen iPhones that\nwere erased of their memory and resold. Some Uber drivers there\nwould then create dozens of fake email addresses to sign up for\nnew Uber rider accounts attached to each phone, and request rides\nfrom those phones, which they would then accept. Since Uber was\nhanding out incentives to drivers to take more rides, the drivers\ncould earn more money this way.</p>\n\n<p>To halt the activity, Uber engineers assigned a persistent\nidentity to iPhones with a small piece of code, a practice called\n“fingerprinting.” Uber could then identify an iPhone and prevent\nitself from being fooled even after the device was erased of its\ncontents.</p>\n\n<p>There was one problem: Fingerprinting iPhones broke Apple’s rules.\nMr. Cook believed that wiping an iPhone should ensure that no\ntrace of the owner’s identity remained on the device.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What Isaac is reporting here doesn&#8217;t require any code running on an iPhone other than when the Uber app is itself installed and launched. I&#8217;m speculating here, but it could be something like this:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The Uber app, while installed, fingerprints the device somehow, and reports the fingerprint home to Uber&#8217;s servers, where it is tied to the user&#8217;s Uber account. (All iPhones have a Unique Device Identifier &#8212; &#8220;UDID&#8221; &#8212; but <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/5898282/what-a-udid-is-and-why-apples-rejecting-apps-that-want-yours\">Apple banned third-party apps from accessing it in 2012</a>. Uber either found a way to access UDIDs surreptitiously, or created some other way of uniquely identifying devices even after they&#8217;ve been wiped. It would be good to know exactly what they did, but for the sake of my argument here it doesn&#8217;t matter.)</p></li>\n<li><p>The Uber app is deleted from the device and/or device is wiped. At this point, Uber knows the fingerprint for the device, but can’t use it to track the device in any way, <em>and they don’t care</em>, because until someone reinstalls the Uber app on the phone it isn&#8217;t being used to book fraudulent rides.</p></li>\n<li><p>The Uber app is reinstalled on the iPhone. When it launches, it does the fingerprint check and phones home again. Uber now knows this is the same iPhone they’ve seen before, because the fingerprint matches. This is the violation of Apple&#8217;s privacy policy.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>But until step 3, when the Uber app is reinstalled, I don&#8217;t think Uber was &#8220;tracking&#8221; the phone in any way. And they didn’t care — the Times says the whole project was designed to counter fraud in China, which required the Uber app to be reinstalled on stolen iPhones.</p>\n\n<p>Repeating from the opening of the article, Isaac wrote:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>So Apple would not find out that Uber had been secretly\nidentifying and tagging iPhones even after its app had been\ndeleted and the devices erased &#8212; a fraud detection maneuver that\nviolated Apple’s privacy guidelines.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That <em>sounds</em> like Uber was doing the identifying and &#8220;tagging&#8221; (whatever that is) after the app had been deleted and/or the device wiped, but I think what it might &#8212; <em>might</em> &#8212; actually mean is merely that the identification persisted after the app had been deleted and/or the device wiped. That&#8217;s not supposed to be technically possible &#8212; iOS APIs for things like the UDID and even the MAC address stopped reporting unique identifiers years ago, because they were being abused by privacy invasive ad trackers, analytics packages, and entitled shitbags like Uber. That&#8217;s wrong, and Apple was right to put an end to it, but it&#8217;s far less sensational than the prospect of Uber having been able to identify and &#8220;tag&#8221; an iPhone <em>after</em> the Uber app had been deleted. The latter scenario only seems technically possible if other third-party apps were executing surreptitious code that did this stuff through Uber&#8217;s SDK, or if the Uber app left behind malware outside the app&#8217;s sandbox. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the case, if only because I don&#8217;t think Apple would have hesitated to remove Uber from the App Store if it was infecting iPhones with hidden phone-home malware.</p>\n\n<p>The article does raise some questions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>What APIs and device info was Uber using to identify iPhones? Are these API loopholes now closed in iOS? If we don&#8217;t learn exactly what Uber was using to identify devices, we cannot know that the technique no longer works. iOS users should be able to feel confident that when they delete an app, all connections between their device and the developer of the app are disconnected, and that when they wipe a device, everything personally identifying has been removed from it.</p></li>\n<li><p>What exactly did Apple know about Uber&#8217;s actions in this regard when Tim Cook called Kalanick in for the meeting? Was Apple aware that Uber was specifically keeping a database of unique iPhone identifiers? If so, how?</p></li>\n<li><p>What prompted Apple to investigate Uber in this regard? And why did Uber suspect Apple was going to investigate, prompting them to geofence their fingerprinting so it wouldn&#8217;t trigger in Cupertino? (My theory: the Uber app was calling private APIs, and they used the geofence to avoid calling those private APIs while the app was in App Store review, assuming, perhaps incorrectly, that all App Store reviewers work in Cupertino. App Store review can identify apps that call private APIs.)</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Update</strong>: Why didn&#8217;t Apple require Uber to disclose what they’d done as a condition for remaining in the store? Shouldn&#8217;t iPhone users who had Uber installed know about this?</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>[<strong>Update 2:</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chronic/status/856250223777206273\">Will Strafach examined a 2014 build of the Uber iOS app</a> and found them using private APIs to use IOKit to pull the device serial number from the device registry. There might be more, but this alone is a blatant violation of App Store policy. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chronic/status/856333895050178560\">Strafach confirms</a> that the technique Uber was using no longer works in iOS 10.]</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>The article also contains this non-Apple-related tidbit:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Uber devoted teams to so-called competitive intelligence,\npurchasing data from an analytics service called Slice\nIntelligence. Using an email digest service it owns named\nUnroll.me, Slice collected its customers’ emailed Lyft receipts\nfrom their inboxes and sold the anonymized data to Uber. Uber used\nthe data as a proxy for the health of Lyft’s business. (Lyft, too,\noperates a competitive intelligence team.)</p>\n\n<p>Slice confirmed that it sells anonymized data (meaning that\ncustomers’ names are not attached) based on ride receipts from\nUber and Lyft, but declined to disclose who buys the information.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is, needless to say, super shitty. We expect it from Uber. But Slice should be ashamed of themselves. Their <a href=\"https://unroll.me/\">Unroll.me</a> service is billed as a tool to &#8220;Clean up your inbox&#8221; by identifying subscription emails and allowing you to unsubscribe from them in bulk. It&#8217;s &#8220;free&#8221; in the sense that you don&#8217;t pay them money, but they&#8217;re selling your personal information to companies like Uber. Supposedly that information is anonymized, but wiped iPhones are supposed to be anonymized too, and Uber found at least one route around that. </p>\n\n\n\n    "

Trying to defeat the established\nsmartwatch players by playing their game won’t work. Is there\nsomething in Swatch Group’s culture that predisposes it to be\ncompetitive with Google and Apple software engineers?</p>\n\n<p>Just as Nokia should have embraced Android in 2010, riding on its\nproven combination of Design, Supply Chain, and Carrier\nDistribution prowess to keep a leading role in the smartphone\nrevolution, Swatch could use its native &#8212; but circumscribed &#8212;\ncultural and technical skills to create beautiful, fun\nsmartwatches … that run on Google’s software. But just like\nNokia&#8217;s culture and success prevented it from seizing the Android\nmoment, similar factors will keep Swatch from being a powerful\nplayer in the smartwatch world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I agree. <em>If</em> the Swatch Group wants to make smartwatches, they should almost certainly go with Android Wear, and they&#8217;re almost certainly doomed with their pre-announced homegrown OS. And it&#8217;s crazy that even if they succeed at creating their own OS, that they think it won&#8217;t need frequent updates and bug fixes. That&#8217;s not how computer platforms work, and make no mistake, smartwatches are computer platforms.</p>\n\n<p>But I think the Swiss watch industry would do well to stick to their mechanical guns. They should leave it to computerized gadgeteers to make smartwatches, and focus on making mechanical watches that stand the test of time (no pun intended). I love computers (duh), but I find mechanical watches to be a source of joy, a bulwark against the ever-encroaching computerization of everything.</p>\n\n<p>The bread and butter for high-end watch companies are aficionados who own multiple watches. Almost no one uses multiple smartwatches. People might have old ones in a drawer, but just as with with phones, it&#8217;s only convenient to have one smartwatch <em>in active use</em> at a time. Apple knows this: that&#8217;s why they made it so easy to swap straps &#8212; multiple looks for variety, but just one watch. For watch fans who actually do want multiple watches <em>and</em> a smartwatch, every watch other than their one smartwatch is likely to be a mechanical.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t think the Swiss watch industry has a chance of out-computer-engineering Apple. Instead they should focus on what they&#8217;ve always done: designing and making great mechanical watches &#8212; creating a breath of analog fresh air in an ever-more-digitized world.</p>\n\n\n\n    "

No news organization, let alone one as prestigious in stature and as fastidious about style and usage as The New York Times, should <em>ever</em> describe Mar-a-Lago as &#8220;the Winter White House&#8221;. Prefacing it by &#8220;so-called&#8221; doesn&#8217;t make it right. So-called by whom? By Trump.</p>\n\n<p>There is only one White House. It is in Washington D.C., and it is owned by the U.S. federal government. It is sometimes and rightly called &#8220;The People&#8217;s House&#8221;, because we the people own it, and we vote to elect the president who lives and works in it. No one profits financially when a state visit is held at the White House.</p>\n\n<p>Mar-a-Lago is a private facility owned by Trump himself. When he hosts state visits there, not only does someone personally profit from it, that someone is Trump himself. Using Mar-a-Lago for official state business goes against everything that the actual White House stands for.</p>\n\n<p>This is no little thing. Describing Mar-a-Lago in a news article as &#8220;the so-called Winter White House&#8221; is normalizing out and out corruption &#8212; Trump&#8217;s shameless profiteering off the presidency.</p>\n\n<p>If the Times wants to quote Trump using the phrase, so be it. But the description should never be used in news copy. The New York Times has no more reason to describe Mar-a-Lago as &#8220;the Winter White House&#8221; than they do to refer to their own publication as &#8220;the failing New York Times&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n    "
