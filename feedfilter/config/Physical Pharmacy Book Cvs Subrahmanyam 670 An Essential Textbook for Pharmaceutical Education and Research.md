# Review of Textbook of Physical Pharmaceutics by C. V. S. Subrahmanyam
 
Textbook of Physical Pharmaceutics is a book written by C. V. S. Subrahmanyam, a professor of pharmaceutics at Andhra University, India. The book covers various aspects of physical pharmacy, such as physicochemical properties of drugs, chemical kinetics, rheology, interfacial phenomena, colloids, disperse systems, and dosage forms. The book is intended for undergraduate and postgraduate students of pharmacy, as well as for practicing pharmacists and researchers.
 
The book has 496 pages and is divided into 16 chapters. Each chapter begins with an introduction and objectives, followed by detailed explanations of the concepts and principles, supported by examples, diagrams, tables, and equations. The chapters also include self-assessment questions, exercises, and references for further reading. The book is written in a clear and concise manner, with an emphasis on the practical applications of physical pharmacy in pharmaceutical formulations and quality control.

- Mucoadhesive drug delivery systems

The book is a comprehensive and updated source of information on physical pharmacy, covering both the theoretical and practical aspects. It is suitable for students who want to learn the fundamentals of physical pharmacy, as well as for professionals who want to refresh their knowledge or solve problems related to pharmaceutical formulations and quality control.
  
Physical pharmacy has many applications in the field of drug discovery, development, and delivery. Some of the areas where physical pharmacy plays a vital role are:

- Selection of new clinical molecules suitable for drug development based on their physicochemical and biopharmaceutical properties, such as solubility, permeability, stability, and bioavailability[^1^]
- Design of novel excipients and materials for controlling drug characteristics, such as polymorphism, solubilization, dissolution, and targeting[^2^] [^3^]
- Formulation of drug delivery systems for various routes of administration, such as oral, topical, transdermal, nasal, pulmonary, ocular, and parenteral[^2^]
- Optimization of drug product performance and quality by using quality-by-design principles and regulatory science[^2^]

Physical pharmacy is a dynamic and interdisciplinary field that integrates knowledge from physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, engineering, and pharmacy. It provides a scientific basis for understanding the behavior of drugs and drug products in different environments and conditions. It also enables the development of innovative and effective therapies for various diseases and disorders.
