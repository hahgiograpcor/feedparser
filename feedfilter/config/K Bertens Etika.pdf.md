## Moral Relativism
 
Moral relativism is the view that there are no universal or objective moral standards or principles. Instead, morality is relative to different cultures, societies, groups, or individuals. What is right or wrong, good or bad, depends on the norms and values of each context.

K Bertens Etika.pdf explains that moral relativism can be divided into two types: descriptive and normative. Descriptive moral relativism is a factual claim that different people or groups have different moral beliefs or practices. Normative moral relativism is a prescriptive claim that we should respect and tolerate the moral diversity of others, and that we should not judge or interfere with their moral choices.
 
Some of the advantages of moral relativism are that it can promote cultural diversity, pluralism, and tolerance. It can also acknowledge the complexity and variability of human situations and experiences. However, some of the disadvantages of moral relativism are that it can lead to moral confusion, inconsistency, and contradiction. It can also undermine moral criticism, dialogue, and progress. Moreover, it can justify or excuse immoral actions or practices that violate human dignity or rights.
 
## Utilitarianism
 
Utilitarianism is the view that the right action is the one that produces the greatest amount of happiness or pleasure for the greatest number of people. Happiness or pleasure is the only thing that has intrinsic value, while everything else has instrumental value. The moral worth of an action depends on its consequences or outcomes, not on its motives or intentions.
 
K Bertens Etika.pdf introduces two main types of utilitarianism: act utilitarianism and rule utilitarianism. Act utilitarianism is the view that we should judge each action by its own utility or usefulness. Rule utilitarianism is the view that we should follow general rules or laws that have been proven to maximize utility in most cases.
 
Some of the benefits of utilitarianism are that it can provide a clear and objective criterion for moral decision-making. It can also appeal to our common sense and intuition that we should do good and avoid harm. However, some of the drawbacks of utilitarianism are that it can ignore or violate individual rights, justice, or fairness. It can also demand too much sacrifice or responsibility from us. Furthermore, it can be difficult or impossible to measure or compare happiness or pleasure in different situations.
